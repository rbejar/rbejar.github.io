A few [comic-style machines](/download/ComicMachines_SVG.zip) and stuff I have created and used in a number of presentations. I am putting them in the public domain so you can do with them whatever you want. Attribution would be nice, but it is not required. You can find them in [Open Clip Art Library](http://openclipart.org/) too.
